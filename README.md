# Malaria-Detection-using-blood-cell-images-Image-classification-
Extracted infected parasite area in blood cell images as the features using Contour detection. Tested Machine Learning techniques on the features after converting those images (27,560) into table in CSV.Applied Convolutional neural network on images to improvise the accuracy using Tensorflow.
